###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support.

 if a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mentalhealth issues including suicidality which is often comorbid with depression escalate in a pm conversation its much harder for others including the rdepression and rsuicidewatch moderators to help  contrary to common assumptions moderators cant see or police pms

1kysxkv,i’m committing suicide,"I’m just done. I’ve been in pain since I was a teenager. I was just diagnosed with PTSD which basically explains the past decade of my life.

It’s never going to get better. 

I was forced into a mental hospital in February after my situation-ship ended and I had a poor reaction to it because of my attachment wounds. I left there after a few days. These past few weeks I have been so depressed and have not been taking care of myself at all. My room is a shit show. I’m spending every last penny I have on ways I can enjoy my last moments. I’ve been engaging in so much careless behaviors. I just got 3 traffic tickets last week. Spent over $5k in 1 week in dumb shit. 

It’s so dark in my mind. I really tried to get better. I tried therapy. It’s so expensive and I haven’t gotten better. Everyone looks at me weird and differently. The world would just be a better place without me in it. 

All I’ve ever wanted to do was to do great things. I’ve fucked up so much. Every job I had aspirations to improve or move up I fucked up by my reckless careless behaviors. I have very few friends, probably due to my attachment style and how shy and awkward I am. I just can’t do this anymore. Goodbye.

1kz2149,I’ve masked my whole life.,"I’d say ever since I was 10-11  I’ve masked. It was rooted in trying to make my parents happy and keep the peace. They IMO hated each other, but stayed married “to keep the family together”. There was no visible love between them at any point in my life I can remember. They did not date. They did not sleep in the same bed, or even same floor of the house. They did not lovingly touch each other period, not even hugs. Drove separately to events too.

I learned quickly that if I just smiled, was quiet, and did ok in school that things in the house would remain objectively peaceful. My dad had a bad temper. I don’t think he ever hurt my mom, but he sure could have due to size difference and he drank daily. He did financially provide though, I did not want for material things as a child. 

Capital punishment was always on the table for me and I experienced it several times as a smaller child. I was raised on fear. My masking may have even started earlier because of this, but I can’t remember anymore. 

My performance was nearly perfect by the time I was in highschool. I felt like I could be anybody for anyone if the situation required to maintain peace. I was the successful youngest son to my parents. All A’s and B’s through a Bachelors degree, got a good job making 6 figures (that was more luck than anything), and got married. Objectively, a decent son from my parent’s Christian views. Problem was, outside of marriage, none of this was for me. I never had any real goals for myself. I never dreamed of a job or career. I was just surviving. I think the only thing I wanted was a good marriage… the one thing I didn’t see growing up. 

My marriage crumbled and I’m now divorced. I was not a good husband. I wasn’t a bad one either, but my obvious lack of emotional depth led to a slow death of the relationship. There was no emotional connection in the end. She deserves better and I guess I’m glad I’m not wasting her time anymore, if anything. Everything was amicable with the separation. 

Its been a couple months since then and I feel like I’m at a crossroads. I’m living alone now. I don’t have to mask, but I find myself doing it anyway. Its just easier to appear outwardly happy to get what I need from people. People will always help a smiling person more than a sad one, it’s less of an emotional burden on their part. 

Deep down though, I’m so sad. I think I’ve always been sad. Sad that nobody actually knew me, and now I don’t know myself. Sad I have no real goals, no aspirations. Sad I failed my partner and am now alone. Pretty sure the only true character trait I have is anxious attachment, which I know nobody wants. My ability to mask just lets me function in society at this point, but I’m contributing nothing. I probably never contributed anything positive in hindsight. All I’ve ever done for those who have given me their genuine selves to be my friend is given them lies and deceit without malicious intent. It’s all fake. 

Right now I’m just coasting through life researching ways out of it. I don’t want to exist anymore. I don’t want to see 30. I know I’ll hurt a lot of people and my pets. I’ll be one of those “ He did WHAT?” but I just can’t exist anymore. My true self is broken, malformed, and tucked away somewhere deep within. I tried therapy,  but I masked to the therapists too. Minimizing my issues, sometimes flat out lying. I couldn’t help it. Even though it’s their job, I didn’t want to burden them. Meds didn’t help either, they just made me sleep. 

I’m a depressed sociopath.  Even if I wasn’t depressed, I’m still a stain on society. People like me don’t need to exist, and I find some solace in knowing I’ll be doing the right thing for society in the end.

im struggling with what feels like my boyfriend trying more to help his mom out and prioritizing her happiness rather than how that in turn would affect me talk to her act normal pretend nothing is wrong im fucking tired she hurt me and im still forced to be the bigger person i get it probably helps me to be the bigger person but all i wanted was to hear im sorry i tried and tried to do it but it just wrecked me even more i so badly wanted what we had before but she had to go and hurt me i feel like i have to ball all this stuff in because hes struggling too he has worse things going on i know im not supposed to compare but i do struggles no matter how little matter too i was told by my counselor that im aware of my emotions and ways of thinking but i just cantstop it it just wont stop i feel like im losing my mind

1kz7pzr,I need help,"Advice please.

I'm a 33yo male with a serious lack of self confidence. It never used to be like this but there is a few reasons now as to why i feel like this so let me explain.

My deceased Mum was a drug addict, she was taking drugs when she was pregnant with me and the result of that was me being born premature and drug addicted. Naturally, being premature and addicted to drugs had it's consequences. Both appearance wise and the way my brain functions. I have ADHD, Anxiety, Social Anxiety and i am fairly confident Autism but it isn't diagnosed. 

I suck at everything. I function just enough to look after myself and my 12 year old boy, but not enough to lead a normal life like everyone else. I struggle in a work environment, I struggled at school and i struggle with anything considered ""normal."" Even financially i struggle, I am absolutely terrible when it comes to money. So I'm just stuck here in my flat with no friends, no job and nothing to look forward to. 

Back to my appearance. I've had numerous bad encounters. With strangers, with people i know, and with kids. I've had people comment about how i ugly i am, how weird i look, I've had people avoid me, I've had kids not want to sit next to me. Almost like a ""He looks weird, stay away from him"" vibe. But here's the thing.. deep down i am a good guy, I've got a good heart and i just want to live my life without worrying everyday about people judging me. I seen a friend of 17 years for the first time in 3 years yesterday and over that period, as I've got older, i look different and i had the feeling i was being judged by it although there is no definitive proof. It just had the feeling about it. I mentioned about seeing her again soon and nothing was said about it. It was kinda just shrugged off. That hurts so much, because when i was younger i had no problem making, and keeping friends its only now as I've got older things seem to be taking a turn for the worst.

What can i do? It's ruining me at the moment and i fear the old, more confident me before i understood everything isn't coming back. I'm a shadow of my former self. 

Thanks for reading. Please be kind, I've already had numerous suicidal thoughts these last few weeks. ",1748620325,depression,3,1,30/05/2025 15:52,30,5,2025,4,30/05/2025,"I need help Advice please.

1kyx8tr,"26f, I'm exhausted with life. I can't imagine living a ""full"" life.","Nothing about life feels full. I feel like I'm missing almost everything. Ive been in and out of the hospital this week, just diagnosed with severe hyperthyroidism and its given me some relief that my fucked up brain isn't all my fault. I had a thyroid ultrasound and I have a couple nodules, and 2 are moderately suspicious, follow up recommended in a year. I was doing my research and the nodes don't seem to share many characteristics of a cancerous nodual, and I just... Kinda bust into tears. Is it messed up to wish I had cancer? I finally saw a way out. I had a brief moment in time where I was visualizing my funeral, end of life plans, fighting with my family over whether to take chemo or not. I felt peace, and when I realized it's likely not cancer idk man, I just got so irritated. I'm clearly not made for life, why am I being put through this shit you know? 

I'm doing life alone, my parents haven't even checked in on me since my hospital trip, and my mother felt the need to overshadow it by telling me she ""was feeling bleh and needed to be alone"". Ive been dealing with mystery symptoms slowly ruining my life and according to lab work that would have started in 2018. So it's been a while, and everyone's just thought I've been crazy and can't get my shit together. My siblings and I can hardly talk to eachother, everytime we do I just say something wrong and it's not in my head but they judge me for being how I am. Nobody can understand why I can't just make friends, keep a job, get a degree, etc. The only friends I've been able to keep have been my exes and I can't tell my conservative Christian family that, it's bad influence for the kids. 


My soul kitty died on the new year, I had to quit my job that was stressing me out and the pressures of life are collapsing on me. I have no idea how to get through this. 


I feel like I have so many mental deficits from being so isolated for so long, I can't imagine ever being normal again. Every interaction I have with people I embarrass myself and my face turns bright ass red so everyone knows. And recently with my thyroid issues my HR has been spiking when I'm stressed or embarrassed, over 200bpm. So stress has been taking a fricken toll on me. And I just want out. But I could never kill myself, I couldn't do that to my family. 


How have you guys gotten through life? What things keep you going? I try to have faith in God and in Jesus, and I see evidence all the time. But, things just don't get easier and everyday that passes I feel like I have less control. I pray for signs, for a message, for help, and im stuck.

1kz8kak,"May, the darkest month of my life. I’m so tired","May

This has objectively been the worst, heaviest, and hardest month of my entire life. Second place isn’t even close—it’s in a different fucking dimension. I still feel guilty for not being okay, but the truth is, I’m so far from okay that I’ve forgotten what okay even looks like.

Relationship & Housing Turmoil
	•	Abi and I broke up, and I’ve been couch surfing ever since, feeling the emotional weight of the breakup and the intense love and connection we shared.
	•	I’m trying to figure out what to do about housing—thinking about getting a trailer and moving in with my brother in Millbrook/Prattville to be closer to family and my roots.

Career & Financial Stress
	•	I’m juggling my real estate work at Property Champions remotely and starting a new role at Vector Security.
	•	I’m going through onboarding and training for the new job, trying to absorb everything while feeling the pressure to make sales and prove myself quickly.
	•	I’m so far behind financially $25,000 in maxed out past due credit cards, multiple bills in collections, and no money. There’s this constant, suffocating panic in the back of my mind.

Family & Personal History
	•	I recently found out the truth about my dad’s death: died when I was 17, I’m 31 now, I was told it was cancer. he didn’t die of cancer—he killed himself.
	•	My mom knew immediately, and my siblings found out at different times over the years—but they’ve all known for years except for me.
	•	Learning this truth has been devastating and disorienting, especially on top of everything else.

Dogs & Letting Go
	•	I got rid of Jenny thinking it would solve some problems, but it didn’t.
	•	And with Winter, who’s been my light for the past nine years, I realized I’m in no position to take care of anyone or anything right now—not even her.
	•	In one of the hardest decisions of my life, I called my ex-wife and asked if she’d take Winter back because I’m in such a rough place. She did.

Mental & Emotional Turmoil
	•	I’ve been carrying years of self-doubt, low self-esteem, impulsive behaviors, and anxiety.
	•	Facing the financial mess and the weight of these family revelations has forced me to see just how dangerously low my self-worth and self-love have been.
	•	It’s all wrapped up in everything else I’m dealing with—heartbreak, family wounds, money worries, career transitions, and these deep, gnawing questions about whether I’ll ever be okay again.

I have many people in my corner who support me the best they can, but I have such a hard time telling them how much I’m REALLY struggling. I know I shouldn’t feel like this, but I still do.

It’s okay for me to feel like this is a lot, right?",1748622341,depression,2,0,30/05/2025 16:25,30,5,2025,4,30/05/2025,"May, the darkest month of my life. I’m so tired May

1kz7dz2,Dealing with depression & anxiety along with other mental health problems is so hard,"Hey guys, 
So i’ve had diagnosed depression & anxiety for 7 years now but im facing new problems.

1kz74je,I’m so tired,"I recently finished a PHP & IOP program at a stress center. I was on the verge of suicidal before going there, even during my first week I was damn near done.

At the end I finally felt like a normal human being. I don’t think I’ve felt that was since elementary school. It wasn’t that childlike happiness but for the first time I didn’t feel heavy. It didn’t take long, like a month, to become depressed and tearful again. 

I can’t get over my lost childhood and how no one cared or believed me how hard it was and how lonely and depressed I had become. And somehow as an adult those same people can’t understand or care, idk which it is, that I’m not okay. That’s an incredibly simplified version of my thoughts but I’m not about to go into my whole life story. 

Anyway, these things led me to being vulnerable in college and being in an abusive relationship and not having any kind of support system in place to help me leave; drinking heavily till I couldn’t handle being sober aka now I’m a (sober) alcoholic, I genuinely don’t believe that would’ve happened if things had been different; and getting to a point of depression where I can’t imagine feeling better and feeling normal. I’ve been living in numbness and ignoring how I feel for over a decade and now I can’t manage it. But I have no one to help me. I have my husband, and he’s amazing, but I need more than just him.

1kz61ma,I hate myself for being happy in the past.,"Been self reflecting a lot. I made a pretty grim realization that I was happy and thriving in the past... When I was a narcissistic a-hole. 

It's truly baffling how and why that was the case. Somehow I made friends... not like the rowdy kids, I was friends with the cool, genius, popular type kids in my school. Idk why they tolerated someone like me.

I would always try to become the center of attention, always...even if other people get hurt. So much so that when we had a mock award ceremony in class... I got ""most self-centered"" (not actual note in paper but I can read between the lines) (real shit). But I didn't mind, they were fine hanging out with me. 

I wasn't a slouch on academics as well, I made honor roll all school year long. I was in top form so to speak.

Idk when I developed it, but I became aggressively aware of what I am. Immediately regretted everything I did. My spirit was crushed. I questioned my being on why I was ever like that. I was so ashamed to show my face to anyone that I began to cut class...something I've never done before...finding myself sitting on mall benches ...alone. That way I couldn't be a burden to anybody. (except for my older brother who was putting me through school, can't seem to stop hurting people whatever bloody choice I make.)

I apologized to some of the people I mistreated, but that only brought more pain for me as I was hoping that they don't take it on bad faith. I truly am sorry. I wish I could apologize to all of them. But I bet they'd rather not spend another second hearing or reading my name on their contacts.

It was too much for me, immediately dropped school to collect myself and try again the next year. But I never recovered. Did make new friends...tried to change...but It was hard...I felt fake...It didn't help that I was made to be the groups source of test answers. It was pathetic that I allowed that to happen to me. But hey, friends...

Eventually cut them off not by my own decision...moved to a new town. No friends, no desire to have friends. Second guessing what to do and say to avoid scrutiny to save whatever's left of my self-respect. But sometimes the true me SLIPS OUT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT. IT'S PATHETIC AND DISGUSTING HOW I'M LIVING LIKE THIS. EVERYTIME I LOOK AT PEOPLE THAT I'M INTERESTED TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH, I SEE MYSELF STARING BACK TELLING MYSELF TO SIT THE HELL DOWN AND SHUT UP.

I know it's a given to be extra kind in this sub. But I am really having a hard time writing and sharing this here. I just want to say that I'll be fine and accept any opinions you might have of me no matter what flavor.

So here's my new plan:

Buy some timber, some nails and a hammer for a makeshift ladder.

Tie a noose.

Drive to a forest and find a suitable tree.

Use the makeshift ladder to climb to a comfortable bough, with the noose and a backpack full of weed, beer and whisky. 

Kick the ladder away.

Get comfortable on the branch and place the noose around my neck.

Drink and smoke until I pass out.

Fall, semi-conscious, if not unconscious, from the tree.

Job done.

1kz8yq5,"I feel like I’m slowly falling apart, and no one really sees it.","Lately, I’ve been feeling like I’m disappearing. Not in a dramatic way — just like I’m fading into the background of life. I’ve been carrying a lot that I haven’t really talked about. I lost my dad not long ago, and it still doesn’t feel real. I also lost my pet — a little rabbit who actually meant a lot to me. Those two losses hit me harder than I expected.

On top of that, I’ve always struggled with social anxiety. I’m an introvert, and it feels almost impossible to open up to people in real life. Even when I try, I feel nauseous, like my body shuts me down before I can speak. I have only 1 close friend, he lives very far away and doesn’t have that much time. Most days, it feels like I don’t have anyone at all. Just… silence.

And recently, someone came into my life who made me feel hopeful — gave me signs that they cared, that maybe something was there. For the first time in a while, I felt wanted. But then, suddenly, they just told me they weren’t interested. And it broke me. I know it was only a couple months, but it felt like I was finally climbing out of this hole — and then just got kicked right back in.

Now, all I can think about is how lonely I am. I look in the mirror and don’t like what I see. I feel underweight, unattractive, and honestly… just kind of worthless. Like if I vanished tomorrow, only my parents would even notice. And that thought has been eating away at me.

I don’t know what I’m hoping for here. Maybe I just needed to say it out loud. Maybe I’m hoping someone out there has felt this too — and made it through. Because right now, it’s hard to believe it gets better.

1kz2kt9,Another 25 who is at their (potentially) lowest ... so far,"Hi guys,

Don't know how to properly start this, and I'm not entirely sure what exactly I am looking for at this point. You have probably read a similar situation of someone, somewhere on the internet at some point in time.

I think I will just start with what happened. I was working for this company since October, and everything was basically fine. The pay was good, and I didn't have to deal with anything beside the work itself. Until I got a letter saying the contract would be ended prematurely on May 22nd. The letter arrived on April 22nd, stating the reason as being... unfit to work. I tried to appeal, but it didn't work. Also, they would be holding out on both April and May paychecks. I was devastated. I picked up the job while I was in a lot of debt with the bank, from a student loan and investments with a local coffee shop chain (I worked for them for 5 years). I was both overjoyed for a job paying this well ($1100/month is a lot where I'm from) and hesitant because I had to work graveyard hours for the entirety of the contract. I eventually took the job, and it turned out to be my lifesaver at that time.

And just a couple of days before May 22nd, my girlfriend broke up with me. This left me further questioning my competency. I loved her. I have known her for six years, and we had been together for 2.5 years. Then things got cold, but eventually, we got back together for a year at that point. I couldn't bring myself to question or to hate her, not at all. Now that the job is gone, the immense pressure of the $5K+ debt is rushing behind my back every month, and I have a bank account of $44 left.

Things I have tried so far include renewing my resume, applying here and there to all the positions that I might qualify for, and looking for projects or part-time work that I used to do. But the job marketplace is truly grim here.

I have never been this desperate, for a job or basically for anything. I failed the driver's license exam yesterday too, a stupid mistake on my end. I got 3/4 exams, so just one step away from getting it. I was really hoping that I could pass to potentially be a driver just to make it through. I spent days practicing for that exam only to fail it because of a stupid mistake. I can't even pay the $50 that was asked by the exam provider for the practicing hours. I don't know what to feel or how to deal with the situation. I just feel embarrassed, helpless, and foolish. I have never been here and have never sought something on the internet like this, let that be either an outlet or advice. But thank you, truly, to anyone who has read this post. I wish you well!

TLDR: I'm 25. I expected a lot more from myself at 25 when I was younger.

Don't know how to properly start this, and I'm not entirely sure what exactly I am looking for at this point. You have probably read a similar situation of someone, somewhere on the internet at some point in time.

I think I will just start with what happened. I was working for this company since October, and everything was basically fine. The pay was good, and I didn't have to deal with anything beside the work itself. Until I got a letter saying the contract would be ended prematurely on May 22nd. The letter arrived on April 22nd, stating the reason as being... unfit to work. I tried to appeal, but it didn't work. Also, they would be holding out on both April and May paychecks. I was devastated. I picked up the job while I was in a lot of debt with the bank, from a student loan and investments with a local coffee shop chain (I worked for them for 5 years). I was both overjoyed for a job paying this well ($1100/month is a lot where I'm from) and hesitant because I had to work graveyard hours for the entirety of the contract. I eventually took the job, and it turned out to be my lifesaver at that time.

1kyn38a,I’m ending my life tonight,"I'm 17 and a I'm a waste of space. I'm just starting out my life, and I know I don't have any value. I feel like my only worth is to die. To be the reason for the people in my life to ask their loved ones if they are ok. To help prevent this happening to another person. I feel that's my purpose, and I'll do it well. 

But there's some part of me that wishes I can just hold on. I'm not good at anything, not science or math or english. I'm not good at sports or art or music. I'm alright at history, but if I were to ever pursue a career in history my parents would jam a stake into my heart and then their own. I wanted to be a veterinarian, or at least a veterinarian nurse. But I've come to realise, even if I did live long enough for that to happen, my parents would hate me for it. 

It's been five years of constantly feeling like this. I think I'm going to fail high school. I don't want to, but I'm so useless and stupid I might. The worst part is about feeling like this, is that nobody has noticed. My mother yelled at me just before I was writing this. 

I really love my mum. And my dad. And my siblings. And my cousin. There's not a thing in the world I wouldn't do for them. Except get good grades because I'm useless at that. Or live. 

I miss my mum. And my dad. And my siblings. And my cousins. 

I like making up stories in my head. I have these two consistent characters, Clara and Damon, that are someway included in every story I make. Clara's a sweet, beautiful kind girl who's smart and gentle. Damon's loud, fast-paced, sarcastic and rambunctious in a functional way. Clara helps people, Damon creates things. In a way, Damon is me if I were interesting, and Clara is who I wish to be. Clara is the framework I use for all of my romance-centric stories, Damon is who I use for my fantastical, epid stories. They are both a part of me, in one way or another, and it's sad to see them go when I die. They have been my constant companions in my life, my thin shred of any self-importance I had felt throughout my years. 

I've tried to love myself, I've tried to get better, I really have. But what's the point of trying if there's no one there to help you. Or at the very least, applaud you for trying. I know failing a test isn't be all end all, but no one is there to tell me otherwise. 

I'm so tired of trying and getting nothing. I'm a leech. I'm a pest. If I were gone, so many people wouldn't have to worry about me. They'd be free, and I'd be dead.

I've decided that after my final exam, I'm going to my best friend's house and hang out with her for a bit. Maybe I'll gain a bit of will to live. Hopefully not. But after that, I'm ending my life.

1kyx06u,"I don't know what's wrong with me, I don't want to feel this way anymore.","I dont know whats wrong with me, I'm only 17 and I shouldn't feel this way. I haven't been myself in idk how long.
I have an idea where these feelings stem from: school, home life (which isn't totally bad but it's not the best), and just bad mental health since I can remember.
As corny as it sounds I feel like there's this darkness inside of me that grows stronger day by day.
I used to have big dreams and so many things I wanted to accomplish, but now I have no motivation for anything.
I don't even know the right words to describe this feeling, sad? upset? mad?
None of those words sound right.
but I can't remember the last time I was genuinely happy.
whenI first started noticing these feelings it would only come around at night or when I'm alone for too long, but now it's a constant feeling that won't go away.
I've lost interest in all my hobbies and started failing school.
I've never done good in school before, but this year has been the worst.
I'm a junior and I've barely kept my head above water. Almost all my graduation required classes I'm failing badly to the point my counselor there's no saving it, I don't even qualify for summer school.
It got to the point where I'm begging my mom to let me do online school next year just so that I can feel some type of relief from this feeling. I'm willing to miss all the senior events next year.
homecoming, prom, senior class field trips, cheer, leaving my bsf, etc.
all those things I'm willing to miss out on just so I can feel a little better.
I turned to things I promised myself I would NEVER do. (drinking, smoking, vaping, etc)
When I first started doing those things it was once a month, but once a month turned to every weekend, and every weekend turned to almost everyday. 
I've had so many people ask what's going on with me, I've never acted this way, but I can't even give them an answer because I've been asking myself the same thing.
Now my only motivation to get through the week/day is knowing I'll get to drink or smoke at the end of it.
It's gotten so bad to the point where I want to give up on everything, including life.
I don't see a point  in living anymore.
everyday is the same, but also somehow worse than the last.
I don't believe I'll ever get better, I don't see the light at the end of the tunnel.
I so badly want to find my peace and be happy again but I feel like the only way that would happen is if I disappear forever. I don't know if I mean dying when I say that, I don't know what I mean when I say anything anymore.
I don't even know who I am, I catch myself dissociating all the time. I feel like I'm watching my life go by through a window, or like I'm in a video game.
Nothing feels real.
life just feels like one big blob if ykwim.
idk how much longer I can keep going, I want to stop feeling like this. I just want it to stop.
I don't want to die (mainly cause I don't have the guts to kms), but I don't want to live either.

When i was 13, i had to take care of my grandma, i used to wake up early to do her works then i go to school...i used to feel very sleepy at school still i never complain.

I never complain for anything as i always feel they already have lots of problems to deal with.

Even though i tell my mother about my father or i don't feel good...she told me to pray to god or forget about it, only then i could live the life happily.

I am not even pretty enough to get a boy as my relatives always tell me to work on myself as i am not good enough and no one will marry me.

I'm not smart or rich enough to get into good university.

Idk what did i do wrong to deserve this life.

1kyzw8j,Drowned Sorrows,"I had a really dark day a few days ago. Im talking as soon as i woke up debilitating hopelessness, emptiness. I didnt know who i could talk to and be honest with. Without judgement or stupid advice. I dont mesh well with therapy apparently im very particular with who i let into my head aside from anonymous posts on here. I was never taught how to express emotions or ever had a safe space to speak on how i feel. I just tell myself tell the therapist what u journal about. Tell them about what u post. And sometimes i do and they tell me, offer me advice i already know. Why am i spending hundreds of dollars for therapy when it does nothing and they all say i need antidepressants anyway. Ive had 4 different therapists in like 6 years of me trying it out. And ive had 1 psychologist. 1 terrible try with antidepressants. Anyways yeah i had a really bad day which lead to daydreaming about how id end it all. Which lead to a few days later me walking into a liquor  store for the 1st time. Im 23. Buying two bigger bottles of some gin and vodka. And as soon as i got home im taking shot after shot. I hit 3 im feeling great, but do i stop. Nooooo i take a 4th then a 5th mind u that gin 80 proof. Vodka 70proof guess which im takin more of. Yeah by the 5th i feeling nothing buth that fuzzy here but not here thing. Im laughing and i dont even know what. My dad is a functioning alcoholic. And a chain smoker. I hate cigarettes and for the longest i hated alcohol. Then i tasted vodka got blind drunk (in my house) well my parents house. Felt what liquor does. How it makes u feel. The realized a hangover isnt anything. I get headaches all the time without liquor. I feel like shit 6days outta the week anyway. So the trade off aint too bad. I took 8 shots i think. My problem with liquor is i dont stop when i feel good. I keep going keep pushing until walking is barely possible. Until i dont rember how i ended up in my bed. Until all u can do is sleep it off. Why? Who knows its not cause it tastes good. It dont taste like much of nothin but strong. And every time i do it get drunk. I have someone judgeing me. I might annoy someone whose in the house a little but i mostly just stay in my room lie on the floor for a bit cause the room spinnin. I judge myself more though the day after. ""Why the fuck would u do that."" 
""What the hell is wrong with u."" Ive only gotten that drunk 6 times every single time i was alone. Drinking alone is depressing but i dont have anyone to drink with and so i take a shot alone egg myself to take more and more and more. Liquor makes me warm when im cold, makes me laugh when all ive been doing is cry, drowns out all thoughts. I see why my dad drinks. I dont want to become him tho.

But I’m making us fight constantly because I can’t stay positive and deescalate his anxiety. But I feel like I’m out of brightness. I can’t.
